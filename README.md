#Caesar Cipher

Caesar Cipher is a simple Single-Page Application that handles messages with Caesar Cipher, a form of cryptography. Caesar Cipher is my first fully-independent project.

Caesar Cipher is made mostly using React and Boostrap, with very minor HTML and CSS. The application also has responsive web-design considered.

It allows the user to encode and decode text. The cipher is case-sensitive, and only converts alphabetical characters: Non-alphabetical characters are simply ignored using the cipher.
